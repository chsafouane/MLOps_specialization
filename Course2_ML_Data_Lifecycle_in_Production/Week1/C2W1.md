In production grade ML, there are several challenges:

- Build integrated ML systems
- Continuously operate it in production
- Handle continuously changing data
- Optimize compute resource costs

## Lecture 2: ML pipelines

An ML pipeline is an ML architecture to automate, monitor and maintain model training and deployment.
