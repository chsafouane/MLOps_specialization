# Intro to ML Engineering in Production

## Lecture 1: Overview

Academic ML vs. Production ML

In production grade ML, there are several challenges:

- Build integrated ML systems
- Continuously operate it in production
- Handle continuously changing data
- Optimize compute resource costs

## Lecture 2: ML pipelines

An **ML pipeline** is  software architecture to implement the ML workflow. Its **goal** is to automate, monitor and maintain model training and deployment.

ML workflows are usually a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG). **Orchestrators** (e.g: Airflow, Kubeflow, Luigi) are responsible for scheduling various components of an ML pipeline based on dependencies defined by a DAG.

**Tensorflow Extended** (TFX) is an open-source end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines. A TFX pipeline is a sequence of  scalable components that can handle large volumes of data.

# Collecting data

## Lecture 1: Importance of data

In an ML pipeline, Data is a first class citizen. Code in Software = Data in an ML application.

Meaningful data is data that has some predictive content to it. It should **maximize predictive content** (and remove non-informative data) and **should have a good feature space coverage**.

## Lecture 2: Example Application

## Lecture 3: Responsible Data: Security, Privacy & Fairness

ML systems can fail users in different ways:

- **Representational harm**: A system amplifies or reflects a negative stereotype about a particular group
- **Opportunity denial**: A system makes predictions that have real-life negative impacts (and sometimes may have lasting consequences)
- **Disproportionate product failure**: You get skewed outputs more frequently for a particular group of users
- **Harm by disadvantage**: when the system infers disadvantageous associations with particular demographics and the user behavior
