In production grade ML, there are several challenges:

- Build integrated ML systems
- Continuously operate it in production
- Handle continuously changing data
- Optimize compute resource costs

## Lecture 2: ML pipelines

An **ML pipeline** is  software architecture to implement the ML workflow. Its **goal** is to automate, monitor and maintain model training and deployment.

ML workflows are usually a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG). **Orchestrators** (e.g: Airflow, Kubeflow, Luigi) are responsible for scheduling various components of an ML pipeline based on dependencies defined by a DAG.

**Tensorflow Extended** (TFX) is an open-source end-to-end platform for deploying production ML pipelines. A TFX pipeline is a sequence of  scalable components that can handle large volumes of data.
