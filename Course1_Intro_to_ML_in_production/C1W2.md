# Selecting and Training a Model

## Lecture 1: Modeling overview

## Lecture 2: Key challenges

AI system = Code (model/algorithm) + Data

**Challenges** in model development:

1. Doing well on training set
2. Doing well on dev/test sets
3. Doing well on business metrics/project goals: Doing well on dev/test sets doesn't mean doing well on business metrics

## Lecture 3: Why low average error isn't good enough

**Case 1: Performance on disproportionately important examples**

In the case of web search algorithm, the user wouldn't tolerate not getting the result she/he wants in case of navigational queries. The search engine will quickly lose the trust of its users in this case

**Case 2: Performance on key slices of the dataset**

Even if the ML model has high average testing accuracy, if it gives irrelevant predictions for some group then this might be unacceptable.

**Case 3: Rare classes**

Specifically in the case of **skewed data distribution** (imbalanced classes)

A related problem to this one is **accuracy in rare classes**. If someone has a rare medical condition, the model might do badly on it because it is not the present in the training dataset but from a medical standpoint, it might be unacceptable not to be detected. => *I think this one is the same as case 2.*
