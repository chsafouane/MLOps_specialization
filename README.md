# MLOps specialization

This repo contains the notes I've taken while doing the [MLOps specialization by DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops) on Coursera.

The repo contains notes of the lectures as well as my own summaries of the references listed in the course. As I'm only done with the first course, this repo is still work in progress.
